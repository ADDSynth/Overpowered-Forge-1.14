v1.4.2 - TBD
NEW:
  Added an alternate crafting recipe for the Inverter.
  Added Project E EMC values to Silicon and the Circuit items.
  The drawn ItemStacks in the Portal Control Panel gui now cycle between all
    valid Gem Blocks that can be accepted in the Portal Frames, and also show
    an Item tooltip if you mouse over them, just like the drawn ItemStacks in
    the Circuit Fabricator gui.
  Added Issue Tracker to the mods.toml file.
CHANGED:
  The Fusion Core is now crafted with Blaze Powder instead of Fire Charges.
FIXED:
  Fixed es_es.json language files.
  Efficiency text in the Crystal Matter Generator was overlapping itself.
  Fixed the drawn ItemStacks in the Circuit Fabricator gui glitching while the
    machine was running.



v1.4.1 - January 6, 2022
NEW:
  Added 2 commands to ADDSynthCore that help in determining the number of ore blocks
    in a given area. Mostly useful to developers.
  Added furnace smelting recipes for the Energy Crystal and Steel Ingots, so these can be
    automated using electric furnaces from other mods.
    - But using the Blast Furnace is still more efficient if you're not getting free energy.
  Added another crafting recipe for the Light Block that uses Energy Crystals.
    - Because I'm sure I'm not the only one that keeps making 9 Energy Crystals
      only to realize you can't make a Light Block from them.
CHANGED:
  Was definitely not generating enough Silicon Ore, so we've changed the default generation
    config values in this update to generate more Silicon.
  No longer registers a Bronze Ingot crafting recipe if Immersive Engineering or Mekanism is installed.
  Changed the Black Hole erase algorithm default speed from 50% of a tick to 20%.
  The Black Hole no longer has a collision box, similar to the Null Block. This means you won't
    be able to break the Black Hole to stop it from erasing the world.
FIXED:
  Fixed the Fusion Chamber not dropping when mined.
  Fixed Ores that drop an item not being affected by Pickaxes with the Fortune effect.
  Finally added the Job system. Now the Magic Infuser and Circuit Fabricator
    (machines with more than 1 input slot) will now show their Time Remaining correctly.
  More recipe advancement fixes.



v1.4 - July 26, 2021
INFO:
  Moved all materials to a new ADDSynth Materials mod.
   - This once again breaks your old worlds, and Forge will warn you of the missing items.
   - Hopefully this should be the last time, because I'm not planning on splitting off
      items into a new mod again.
   - This time I tried to use a DataFixer to seamlessly convert your world data to the new
      format, but the DataFixer stuff was much too complicated for me to figure it out
      without documentation, so I have to wait for someone to explain how it works before
      I can use it.
  The Overpowered mod was renamed to Overpowered Technology.
  Starting in version 1.5.x, the mod_id for Overpowered Technology will be renamed
    from overpowered to overpowered_technology.
  Starting in version 1.5.x, ADDSynthCore, ADDSynth Energy, and Overpowered Technology
    will be split apart into 3 separate files.
NEW:
  Added Silicon and Rose Quartz.
  Added more mods to detect:
    The One Probe, Hwyla, The Beneath, Cooking for Blockheads, Tiny Progressions,
    FoamFix, RFTools Utility, Draconic Evolution, Curios, Forestry,
    Immersive Engineering, Immersive Railroading, Track API, Sound Filters,
    Block Renderer, Item Zoom, Neat, and McJtyLib.
    - Updated Pam's Harvestcraft so we can detect it now.
  Added Team Manager.
  Added Circuit Fabricator.
    - Added 8 tiers of circuits.
  Added a standard Generator to ADDSynth Energy.
    - It takes in standard fuel items such as Coal, Charcoal, Wood, and Planks.
    - Now has an HD texture.
  Added a new Scanning Laser item.
  Whitelisted TileEntities to work with Applied Energistics Spatial-IO.
    - As of now, this needs further testing to ensure there aren't any errors.
  Added Celestial Gem:
    - They look and function the same as the Energy Crystal in previous versions.
    - You now get Energy Crystals by smelting Celestial Gems in a Blast Furnace.
  The amount of energy the Energy Crystal, Energy Crystal Shards, and Light Block
    give you in the Crystal Energy Extractor now shows in the tooltip when you
    hover over the item.
  Added Plasma item.
  Added a new debug feature to ADDSynthCore that allows you to print all defined
    block and item tags into text files.
  Added stats for Converting Gems, Firing Lasers, and Identifying Items.
  Added 4 commands to ADDSynthCore. They don't do anything important, they're just
    there to try out and play with.
    [This mod is provided as-is. Any computers that crash as a result of player's misuse
     of these commands is entirely the fault of the player and not the mod developer.]
  Added a config option to ADDSynthCore that swaps the mouse buttons used to Add or Delete
    notes to/from the Music Box.
  Added Swap Track buttons to the Music Box gui.
  If you mouse over a Music Sheet item it now says if it's blank or it contains Music Data.
  Added advancements for the Celestial Gem, Magic Infuser, Advanced Ore Refinery,
    Crystal Matter Generator, Energy Suspension Bridge, Plasma, Rose Quartz,
    the standard Generator, Compressor, and the Circuit Fabricator.
  Added an alternate recipe for the Dimensional Anchor.
CHANGED:
  All materials are now part of the ADDSynth Materials mod.
  The Music Box gui no longer has the JEI item panel. It doesn't need it.
  The Creative Tab icon for ADDSynth Energy is now the new Generator.
  The Generator that was part of Overpowered has been renamed to Crystal Energy Extractor
    and has its own new texture.
  Renamed Energy Crystal to Celestial Gem.
    - You now get Energy Crystals by smelting Celestial Gems in a Blast Furnace.
    - Renamed all Energy Tools to Celestial Tools.
  You now get Energy Crystal Shards by putting an Energy Crystal into the Compressor.
  Renamed mod to Overpowered Technology.
    - This will cause your configuration files to be reset.
  Moved Trophies to ADDSynthCore.
  You now get a Void Crystal from the portal instead of an Unknown Technology item.
   - A Void Crystal is required to craft the Inverter.
  Rebalanced Values:
    Chance to drop an unidentified armor was changed from 1/40 to 1/100.
    Chance a Weird Tree spawns in the Unknown Dimension was changed from 1/500 to 1/2000.
      - But this doesn't mean anything right now because the Unknown Dimension doesn't exist.
    Now that we have a standard generator to power your machines, you won't need as
      many Energy Crystals. Changed the default tries to generate Gem Ore from 4 to 3.
    Reduced the default number of Ores generated.
    Changed the energy the Portal Control Panel requires from 60,000 to 5,000,000.
  No longer registers a Steel smelting recipe if Immersive Engineering or Mekanism is installed.
  Changed the Steel smelting recipe to a Blast Furnace recipe.
  The Dimensional Anchor now has a shaped crafting recipe, like how it was in Minecraft 1.12
    and earlier. (still doesn't do anything.)
  Items which have an alternate recipe now have both recipes in the same group.
  Don't know why the Magic Infuser produces a Fortune II Book, but I've changed that back to
    Fortune I.

  Finally added the ability to get those Advancements that you couldn't get before,
    such as Fire Laser, Fire Laser the Maximum Distance, Portal, World Destroyer,
    and Convert a Thousand Gems.

   - Area is no longer considered obstructed if it contains tall grass.

  ADDSynth Energy is now its own mod.
   - Moved Power Core, Advanced Power Core, Energy Wire, Energy Storage Container,
     Electric Furnace, Compressor, and Universal Energy Interface.
   - As a result, some of the recipes for these have changed.
   - This means that your previous worlds will be incompatible if you upgrade to this
      version. Forge will warn you that some blocks and items are missing.
  Moved config options that specifically alter Machine values into a dedicated
    MachineValues config file.
  New Portal Control Panel texture.
  Advanced Ore Refinery now has its own texture.
  Black Hole Optimization:
   - No longer erases blocks in a single tick, causing lag. Black Hole algorithm
     is now spread across multiple ticks, and also self-balancing, meaning it will
     never go over the tick processing limit.
   - As a result of this, the default radius has been increased from 70 to 90.
  Now prints a message to Players if you try to set down a Black Hole in a Dmension
    that is blacklisted in the Overpowered configuration file.

     and Inverter.
   - Electric Furnace now shows as a valid Furnace for Furnace recipes.
   - Now tells a short description for most things using the built-in JEI Info tab.
  Updated our Energy system:
   - All machines now have a center "working" inventory. When machines are ready to
     work on something, they will move 1 item from the Input to the center and start
     working on them.
   - Some machines now have a Power Cycle time, meaning you can't just turn them off
     and on anymore. After switching a machine off, you have to wait for it to turn off.
   - Energy is now handled as a decimal value, rather than a full integer. This makes
     our machines incompatible with other Energy systems directly, but you can still
     use the Universal Energy Interface machine.
  Added Blast Furnace recipes for our Ores.
   - The Blast Furnace is a vanilla machine new in Minecraft 1.14 which can smelt Ores
      twice as fast. You can now smelt Gem and Metal Ores in the Blast Furnace.

   - Players in Creative Mode can generate a portal without having the proper items or
       required energy.
   - Added an option in the configuration file to "Disable the Unknown Dimension". This
     prevents players from teleporting to the Unknown Dimension, and instead spawns 2
     Unknown Technology items inside the frame of the Portal.
     - Only for the Minecraft 1.12 version. 1.14 Doesn't have the Unknown Dimension and
       does this anyway.
   - The message that indicates the status of the Portal is now Color Coded.
   - Automatically turns itself off after generating a portal.
  Increased Caution block texture from 256x256 to 512x512.
  Custom Mob Drops now drop for the Vex, Illusioner, Drowned, Phantom, Skeleton Horse,
    Pillager, and Ravager.
  Added logo images when you select any of my mods in the Mods List in Forge.
  Now that we have a center slot, the Gem Converter and Inverter machines will show
    the item they're working on to slowly transform into the output item.
    (The items in the center slot will blend together.)
  Oh yeah. ALL GUIS HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED! Before it was just Blocks and Items, but now
    Guis and Advancements have been translated!
  The crafting recipe for the Gem Converter was changed.
  The crafting recipe for the Fusion Core was changed.
  Changed the crafting recipe for the Dimensional Anchor. (still doesn't do anything.)
  You can now disable the Trophy Stand. If it is disabled, Trophies will use a
    Wooden Slab in their crafting recipes instead.
  There is now a configuration option to control whether Rings produce particle effects
    when you wear them.



v1.2 - November 29, 2019
  Made ADDSynthCore into its own mod:
    Moved Caution block, Music Box, and Music Sheet to ADDSynthCore.
     - This means that Forge now recognizes them as part of the ADDSynthCore mod
       and not the Overpowered mod, THE BLOCKS CURRENTLY IN YOUR WORLD ARE INVALID!
       and Forge will warn you that they don't exist. THIS BREAKS YOUR WORLDS!
       You should record your Music Boxes in a separate [fashion].
  REMOVED DEPENDANCY TO BAUBLES! You no longer need Baubles to play this mod,
    however, we do add Unidentified Rings if you do play with Baubles.
  Improved compatability with other mods:
    - *FIXED CRASH when you took items out of any Overpowered machine!
    - Project E: Added missing EMC value for Iron Plate and Gold Plate.
    - The Advanced Ore Refinery now correctly smelts all Ores from all mods.
    - The Electric Furnace now correctly smelts ItemStacks with meta instead of just
      the base Items.
    - Fixed duplication error when picking up Trophy Blocks or the Electric Furnace.
    - Gem blocks from other mods are now allowed in the Portal Frames.
  Added debug features that you can enable in the ADDSynthCore config.
  Added Auto Shutoff feature to Lasers, when checked, Lasers will automatically
    switch off after firing, so they don't accept energy until switched back on.
  Gave Fusion Chamber and Laser Housing machines new textures.
  Added a machine classification subtitle to all machines tooltips.
  Gave HD textures to all tools.
  Added Scythe tools. These are used to chop leaves off of trees very quickly, but
    they drop items as if you had mined them by hand.
  Added Yellorium to the materials list.
  All machines now show how much time must pass to finish work, to run out of energy,
    or to get full of energy.
  All Guis in the 1.12 version now behave normally
    (dark background and shows item tooltips.)
  Fix Laser Machines not working properly in 1.11 and 1.12 versions.
  Machines now resume operating when the world is first loaded or when teleporting
   between dimensions.
  Fix achievements not being registered / not being saved with the player or world
    in the 1.10 and 1.11 versions. - Error started in the last version.
  Fixed Machines now drop the items inside of them when they are broken.
    - This error probably began occurring since the last update.
  Accessing the Config through the Client Gui has now been improved and works.
  Fix the the Music Box being played after the first one was powered.
  Added Universal Energy Interface:
    This machine will keep 1,000 units of energy and interface with other Energy
    APIs so it works with Forge Energy, RF Energy and Tesla energy.
  The crafting recipe for the Portal Control panel now uses Ender Pearls instead of
    Advanced Power Cores.
  This is the first version of the Overpowered mod that will use Forge's built-in
    version checker. Basically it checks for a file on our server for version info,
    and if it finds info for a newer version then it puts a green marker on the Mods
    button on the Minecraft main menu. Click it and it shows you the new version
    changelog and a link on where to download it.
  Fixed trophy texture glitches.
