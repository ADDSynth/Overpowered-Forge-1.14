v1.3 - July 1, 2020
  ADDSynth Energy is now its own mod.
   - Moved Power Core, Advanced Power Core, Energy Wire, Energy Storage Container,
     Electric Furnace, Compressor, and Universal Energy Interface.
   - As a result, some of the recipes for these have changed.
   - This means that your previous worlds will be incompatible if you upgrade to this
      version. Forge will warn you that some blocks and items are missing.
  Moved config options that specifically alter Machine values into a dedicated
    MachineValues config file.
  New Portal Control Panel texture.
  Advanced Ore Refinery now has its own texture.
  Black Hole Optimization:
   - No longer erases blocks in a single tick, causing lag. Black Hole algorithm
     is now spread across multiple ticks, and also self-balancing, meaning it will
     never go over the tick processing limit.
   - As a result of this, the default radius has been increased from 70 to 90.
  Now prints a message to Players if you try to set down a Black Hole in a Dmension
    that is blacklisted in the Overpowered configuration file.
  The Identifier now has an output slot, allowing it to be automated.

     Suspension Bridge. Must have a Lens inside, and turned on by a redstone signal.

     Extra Utilities 2, Forge Multipart, Industrial Craft, JourneyMap, Mantle, Mekanism,

     Thaumcraft (Minecraft 1.12 only), and Tinker's Construct.
   - Results are now aligned in the log file.
  Added new Minecraft 1.14 instruments to the Music Box.
  Added Advancements.
  Improved JEI Support:
   - Now shows recipes for the Gem Converter, Advanced Ore Refinery, Compressor,
     and Inverter.
   - Electric Furnace now shows as a valid Furnace for Furnace recipes.
   - Now tells a short description for most things using the built-in JEI Info tab.
  Updated our Energy system:
   - All machines now have a center "working" inventory. When machines are ready to
     work on something, they will move 1 item from the Input to the center and start
     working on them.
   - Some machines now have a Power Cycle time, meaning you can't just turn them off
     and on anymore. After switching a machine off, you have to wait for it to turn off.
   - Energy is now handled as a decimal value, rather than a full integer. This makes
     our machines incompatible with other Energy systems directly, but you can still
     use the Universal Energy Interface machine.
  Added Blast Furnace recipes for our Ores.
   - The Blast Furnace is a vanilla machine new in Minecraft 1.14 which can smelt Ores
      twice as fast. You can now smelt Gem and Metal Ores in the Blast Furnace.

   - Fixed for the Minecraft 1.14 version.
  The Magic Infuser can now produce the new Enchantments from Minecraft 1.13 and 1.14.
  Improved the Portal Control Panel:
   - Now has more safety checks to ensure the Portal is constructed properly.
   - Playeres in Creative Mode can generate a portal without having the proper items or
       required energy.
   - Added an option in the configuration file to "Disable the Unknown Dimension". This
     prevents players from teleporting to the Unknown Dimension, and instead spawns 2
     Unknown Technology items inside the frame of the Portal.
     - Only for the Minecraft 1.12 version. 1.14 Doesn't have the Unknown Dimension and
       does this anyway.
   - The message that indicates the status of the Portal is now Color Coded.
   - Automatically turns itself off after generating a portal.
  Increased Caution block texture from 256x256 to 512x512.
  Custom Mob Drops now drop for the Vex, Illusioner, Drowned, Phantom, Skeleton Horse,
    Pillager, and Ravager.
  Added logo images when you select any of my mods in the Mods List in Forge.
  Now that we have a center slot, the Gem Converter and Inverter machines will show
    the item they're working on to slowly transform into the output item.
    (The items in the center slot will blend together.)
  Oh yeah. ALL GUIS HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED! Before it was just Blocks and Items, but now
    Guis and Advancements have been translated!
  The crafting recipe for the Gem Converter was changed.
  The crafting recipe for the Fusion Core was changed.
  Changed the crafting recipe for the Dimensional Anchor. (still doesn't do anything.)
  You can now disable the Trophy Stand. If it is disabled, Trophies will use a
    Wooden Slab in their crafting recipes instead.
  There is now a configuration option to control whether Rings produce particle effects
    when you wear them.



v1.2 - November 29, 2019
  Made ADDSynthCore into its own mod:
    Moved Caution block, Music Box, and Music Sheet to ADDSynthCore.
     - This means that Forge now recognizes them as part of the ADDSynthCore mod
       and not the Overpowered mod, THE BLOCKS CURRENTLY IN YOUR WORLD ARE INVALID!
       and Forge will warn you that they don't exist. THIS BREAKS YOUR WORLDS!
       You should record your Music Boxes in a sepereate [fashion]
  REMOVED DEPENDANCY TO BAUBLES! You no longer need Baubles to play this mod,
    however, we do add Unidentified Rings if you do play with Baubles.
  Improved compatability with other mods:
    - *FIXED CRASH when you took items out of any Overpowered machine!
    - Project E: Added missing EMC value for Iron Plate and Gold Plate.
    - The Advanced Ore Refinery now correctly smelts all Ores from all mods.
    - The Electric Furnace now correctly smelts ItemStacks with meta instead of just
      the base Items.
    - Fixed duplication error when picking up Trophy Blocks or the Electric Furnace.
    - Gem blocks from other mods are now allowed in the Portal Frames.
  Added debug features that you can enable in the ADDSynthCore config.
  Added Auto Shotoff feature to Lasers, when checked, Lasers will automatically
    switch off after firing, so they don't accept energy until switched back on.
  Gave Fusion Chamber and Laser Housing machines new textures.
  Added a machine classification subtitle to all machines tooltips.
  Gave HD textures to all tools.
  Added Scythe tools. Thease are used to chop leaves off of trees very quickly, but
    they drop items as if you had mined them by hand.
  Added Yellorium to the materials list.
  All machines now show how much time must pass to finish work, to run out of energy,
    or to get full of energy.
  All Guis in the 1.12 version now behave normally
    (dark background and shows item tooltips.)
  Fix Laser Machines not working properly in 1.11 and 1.12 versions.
  Machines now resume operating when the world is first loaded or when teleporting
   between dimensions.
  Fix achievements not being registered / not being saved with the player or world
    in the 1.10 and 1.11 versions. - Error started in the last version.
  Fixed Machines now drop the items inside of them when they are broken.
    - This error probably began occurring since the last update.
  Accessing the Config through the Client Gui has now been improved and works.
  Fix the the Music Box being played after the first one was powered.
  Added Universal Energy Interface:
    This machine will keep 1,000 units of energy and interface with other Energy
    APIs so it works with Forge Energy, RF Energy and Tesla energy.
  The crafting recipe for the Portal Control panel now uses Ender Pearls instead of
    Advanced Power Cores.
  This is the first version of the Overpowered mod that will use Forge's built-in
    version checker. Basically it checks for a file on our server for version info,
    and if it finds info for a newer version then it puts a green marker on the Mods
    button on the Minecraft main menu. Click it and it shows you the new version
    changelog and a link on where to download it.
  Fixed trophy texture glitches.
