/**
 * <p>A Block Network is a collection of Block Positions of TileEntities that should act as a single
 * entity and/or share data between them. To stay in-sync it needs to be updated whenever a
 * TileEntity is added or removed.
 * 
 * <p>This is a base abstract class which just holds all the standard functionality. The only reason
 * you'd want a BlockNetwork is to hold additional data, so extend this class with your own.
 *
 * <p><b>Required:</b> TileEntities in a Block Network all hold a reference to the SAME Block Network.
 * This reference variable must be in a TileEntity which implements the {@link IBlockNetworkUser} interface.<br>
 * 
 * <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * <p>Here I will describe how BlockNetworks function for my own sanity and others:
 * 
 * <p><b>1.</b> When a player sets down a TileEntity that is new, its block_network variable is null,
 * so it must be initialized to a new BlockNetwork instance. Then it must immediately be updated to add
 * itself to the list of blocks in the BlockNetwork.
 * 
 * <p><b>2.</b> Now say the player places another TileEntity down next to the first one. The easiest
 * solution would be to initialize a new BlockNetwork, and update it. If you do this, then you
 * had BETTER ensure that all TileEntities you find that use this BlockNetwork should be set to THIS
 * BlockNetwork.
 * <p>However, we have a problem. What you did was create a NEW BlockNetwork, then set all TileEntity's
 * block_network variable to this new BlockNetwork. This overwrites the data that any existing
 * BlockNetwork had to their default values.
 * <p>So, the correct way to handle this is, when a TileEntity is created, you first check adjacent
 * positions for existing BlockNetworks, then set our own block_network variable to the one we found.
 * 
 * <p><b>3.</b> So Now let's set down a bunch of TileEntities, and they all share the same BlockNetwork.
 * You Quit the world, then load it back up again. The game will load the TileEntities, but in what order?
 * You can safely assume that the first TileEntity to load will correctly initialize its BlockNetwork field,
 * call its update function, and correctly find all connecting TileEntities and set their block_network variable.
 * So, whenever the World loads the next TileEntity, you'd better ONLY create a new BlockNetwork if it's null.
 * 
 * <p><b>4.</b> What happens when we remove a single TileEntity is pretty straight-forward. Minecraft
 * invalidates the TileEntity and then removes it, and when that happens there are no more references to the
 * TileEntity or its block_network variable. But what about a TileEntity that is a part of a BlockNetwork
 * of multiple TileEntities? Well first we must detect the TileEntity is being removed, then we must update
 * the BlockNetwork, but prevent it from finding the TileEntity that is being removed.
 * 
 * <p><b>5.</b> Continuing from #2, You must've wondered what happens if you place a TileEntity that
 * is adjacent to multiple TileEntities, but they were not connected, so they each have a different
 * BlockNetwork. We still must find an existing BlockNetwork and join it, but which one? Well each one
 * contains the same type of data but possibly different values, it would be far too cumbersome to try
 * to average them all out, so to simplify this case scenerio, we just accept the first one we find and
 * call the update method, which will find all TileEntities and overwrite their block_network variable.
 * 
 * <p><b>6.</b> Continuing from #4, and the inverse of #5, what happens if you have a row of TileEntities,
 * and you remove one in the middle, thus creating multiple BlockNetworks? This is by far the most
 * complicated scenerio that can happen. The TileEntity CAN be removed from the BlockNetwork's internal
 * list of blocks, but all TileEntities are still part of the SAME BlockNetwork, even though there's a gap!
 * So what we need to do is call the updateBlockNetwork function using the position of one of the
 * adjacent TileEntities. This will correctly setup one side of the gap, but not the others! We also need
 * to ensure that we keep the BlockNetwork's data as best as we can.
 * <p>So here's how we do it. when a TileEntity is removed, go ahead and detect which sides have the same
 * type of TileEntity on each side, this means they WERE part of the original BlockNetwork. Call the update
 * method on the first position we find, this will correctly re-assign all block positions. Continue
 * checking all the other sides of the TileEntity being deleted, and if we find a TileEntity, it's either
 * an orphan or now counted as part of the first BlockNetwork. We should check that position against the
 * positions we've just finished discovering from the first BlockNetwork. If they aren't in the new list,
 * that means they are no longer connected, and should be a new BlockNetwork.
 * <p>Any new BlockNetworks we create, we can assign their data to that of the original BlockNetwork's data,
 * but this just duplicates the data. Where there were previously 1 BlockNetwork with the data, now there
 * are 2 or more. This duplicates data such as Energy, or items that were a part of the BlockNetwork.
 * We obviously don't want players to exploit this duplication, so all new BlockNetworks must be reset
 * to their default data.
 *
 * <p><b>7.</b> Oh dang. There's actually one more scenario I forgot about. Some block networks have extra
 * data, sure, but let's say you want to keep a list of TileEntities this BlockNetwork connects to,
 * Tiles that AREN'T part of the Block Network. For example, the {@link EnergyNetwork}
 * keeps track of {@link addsynth.energy.main.IEnergyUser Energy Users} that the network connects to.
 * In this case, you want to update the Block Network (or at least the BlockNetwork's data) whenever
 * you detect the block next to a TileEntity that belongs to this Block Network was CHANGED, because
 * a block could've been added or removed, and you need to update the data accordingly. So, we use
 * {@link Block#neighborChanged(BlockState, World, BlockPos, Block, BlockPos, boolean)}
 * to detect the block beside us has changed and then call our BlockNetwork's update event.
 *
 * <p><b>8.</b> So now let's talk about BlockNetwork data. Out of the 4 BlockNetwork examples that exist in
 * ADDSynth's mods as of writing this, {@link EnergyNetwork} and {@link DataCableNetwork} only store positions
 * of TileEntities. That can be calculated at runtime and doesn't need to save any data to TileEntities.
 * However, {@link LaserNetwork} has a shared boolean value that determines if the LaserNetwork is running
 * or not. When a player toggles the On/Off switch, this must set the BlockNetwork's variable, and then
 * update all TileEntities. And {@link BridgeNetwork} allows a player to insert a Lens in any Suspension Bridge
 * block, and all Bridge blocks share the same network, so the player can access the Lens from any other block.
 * <p>The function for updating all the TileEntities in the {@link BlockNetwork#blocks} list doesn't exist,
 * so you'll have to make your own, and call it whenever your BlockNetwork's data changes. Also, when the
 * world loads, it does create new BlockNetworks, but you also want it to load saved data. For this reason
 * {@link BlockNetworkUtil#create_or_join} automatically
 * calls your TileEntity's {@link IBlockNetworkUser#load_block_network_data()} function.
 *
 * <p><b>9.</b> One last bit of advice. Sometimes a BlockNetwork wants information on another BlockNetwork,
 * so it calls that TileEntity's {@link IBlockNetworkUser#getBlockNetwork()} function. But the return
 * value of that function MIGHT be null. This only happens during World load, when one BlockNetwork starts
 * loading and updating before the other. Because of the way {@link BlockNetworkUtil#create_or_join} is
 * set up right now, you can't put anything in the {@link IBlockNetworkUser#getBlockNetwork()} that will
 * initialize a BlockNetwork because that would cause an infinite loop. Instead, if you depend on
 * another BlockNetwork during a BlockNetwork update, check if it is null and initialize it yourself.
 *
 * <p><b>10.</b> Continuing from #7, This scenerio involves when during the BlockNetwork update, it changes
 * a block in the world, such as by calling {@link World#setBlockState(BlockPos, BlockState, int)}.
 * This will then call {@link Block#neighborChanged(BlockState, World, BlockPos, Block, BlockPos, boolean)}
 * Which can cause some Block Networks to begin updating again, while during the first update, which may
 * trigger a Null Pointer Exception. Argh, I'm not explaining this very well. You must either check
 * if the Block Network is null, or check what kind of BlockNetwork it is and create a new one yourself,
 * which in turn calls that BlockNetwork's update method anyway.
 * <p>Currently, all of our neighbor detections assumes this only occurs during normal gameplay, and NOT
 * DURING WORLD LOAD! So there are no null checks. Luckily it seems that only the Energy Suspension Bridge
 * changes the world during its Block Network update, and it doesn't need to detect when blocks next to it
 * has changed.
